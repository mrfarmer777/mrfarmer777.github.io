### Giving Back to the Club That Started it All
I created this app to help my students and I manage and publicize the goings-on of our computer programming club, the [MHS Byte Club](http://mhsbyte.org). My love of code began in 2014 when the students of this club inspired me with their creativity, collaboration, and limitless persistence. For years, the scope of this project would have been well out of my reach. Now, we have a single place to manage our users, projects, and announcements! We also have a show case for our students' current projects and something students can work to contribute to in the future.
