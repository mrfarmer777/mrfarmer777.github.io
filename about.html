<p>I am a full stack web developer with a background in education, educational technology and research. I enjoy working with others to dig deeper into tough challenges and create unique solutions using a wide variety of technology tools. I am passionate about the use of technology and education as a means for improving equity and social good. I love hiking, music and goofing around with my kids on science-y stuff.</p>
